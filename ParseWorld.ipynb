      "Abstract: The mistreatment of Xiaochaihu Decoction refers to the use of Xiaochaihu Decoction under the wrong pathogenesis. In this case, not only does the old disease not be removed, but the disaster often occurs. The mistreatment of Xiaochaihu Decoction in the research literature helps people to be alert to the suspected symptoms in Xiaochaihu Decoction indications. This topic intends to analyze 12 cases of Xiaochaihu Decoction misdiagnosed in three series of Mingyi Leian. According to the key links in the process of syndrome differentiation, the reasons for the mistakes are summarized in order to provide reference for the use of Xiaochaihu Decoction in clinical trials. The experience includes: ① In febrile diseases, except for exogenous disease and internal damage, patients with exogenous disease need to distinguish yin syndrome or yang syndrome; patients with internal damage need to judge excess syndrome or deficiency syndrome. ② When the symptoms of Shaoyang disease and Yangming disease are combined, it is necessary to fully use the comprehensive analysis of data gained by four diagnostic methods to reduce errors. ③ “Just see a symptom” must be applied under the premise of grasping the adverse mechanism of Shaoyang disharmony; ④ In the treatment stage, the doctors should be patient and accountable for telling patients compatibility and incompatibility of drugs, so as to prevent treatment from getting half the result with twice the effort.\n",

      "摘要:目的:建立并验证慢性萎缩性胃炎(CAG)大鼠模型,运用代谢组学的方法研究CAG大鼠模型代谢组学特征及生物标志物,探讨胃经穴位与胃之间是否存在一定的相对特异性联系｡方法:将32只SD大鼠随机分为空白组和模型组,通过MNNG联合乙醇灌胃､饥饱失常法复制CAG大鼠模型｡HE染色观察大鼠胃组织病理学变化,采用1H-NMR检测足三里穴区及胃组织代谢物并分析所得数据｡结果:造模结束后,模型大鼠胃黏膜色苍白,黏膜层变薄,弹性减少,皱襞变平,黏液减少,有散在出血点,HE染色,光镜下胃组织病理学检查结果可见大量炎性细胞浸润,大量主细胞坏死空泡样变化,大量纤维组织充填,并有诸多集中出血点,腺体结构紊乱减少,固有腺体出现萎缩｡与空白组对比,模型组大鼠胃组织共有17个差异性代谢物,其中乳酸､谷氨酰胺､谷胱甘肽､N-乙酰天门冬氨酸､尿苷二磷酸葡萄糖､肌糖､腺嘌呤核糖核苷酸7个代谢物浓度显著升高,而亮氨酸､牛磺酸､N,N-二甲基甘氨酸､甜菜碱､丝氨酸､ 磷酸胆碱､乙酰磷酸胆碱､尿嘧啶､尿苷､苯丙氨酸10个代谢物浓度显著降低｡与空白组相比,模型组大鼠足三里穴区组织中谷氨酰胺､琥珀酸､赖氨酸､富马酸､次黄嘌呤､一磷酸腺苷显著降低,而N-乙酰天门冬氨酸､天冬氨酸､天冬酰胺､磷酸胆碱/甘磷酸胆碱､酪氨酸､苯丙氨酸､黄嘌呤､肌苷显著升高｡结论:从病理表现上MNNG联合乙醇灌胃､饥饱失常法成功构建了CAG大鼠模型｡代谢组学得出CAG模型大鼠足三里穴区与胃组织之间在病理上相互关联,可初步表明胃经穴位与胃之间存在一定的相对特异性联系｡\n",

      "Abstract: To establish and validate a rat model of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), metabolomics was applied to study the metabolomics characteristics and biomarkers of CAG rat model, and to explore whether there is a certain relative specificity relationship between gastric acupoints and stomach. Methods: Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a blank group and a model group. The CAG rat model was replicated by MNNG combined with ethanol gavage and abnormal of starvation. The pathological changes of gastric tissue were observed by HE staining. The metabolites of Zusanli (ST36) and stomach tissues were detected by 1H-NMR and the data were analyzed. Results: After the model was established, the gastric mucosa of the model rats was pale, the mucosa was thinned, the elasticity was reduced, the folds were flattened, the mucus was reduced, these was scattered bleeding point. In HE staining, the pathological examination of the stomach tissue under light microscope showed a large infiltration of inflammatory cells, a large number of primary cells necrotic vacuole-like changes, a large number of fibrous tissue filling, and a number of concentrated bleeding points, glandular structural disorders reduced, the inherent gland atrophy. Compared with the blank group, there were 17 differential metabolites in the gastric tissue of the model group, including lactic acid, glutamine, glutathione, N-acetyl aspartate, uridine diphosphate glucose, muscle sugar, and adenine ribonucleotides, these 7 metabolites is significantly increased. Leucine, taurine, N, N-dimethylglycine, betaine, serine, phosphorylcholine, acetylphosphocholine, uracil, uridine, phenylalanine, the concentration of these 10 metabolites was significantly reduced. Compared with the blank group, the glutamine, succinic acid, lysine, fumaric acid, hypoxanthine and adenosine monophosphate in the Zusanli (ST36) area of ​​the model group were significantly reduced, while N-acetylaspartate, Aspartic acid, asparagine, choline phosphate/choline phosphate, tyrosine, phenylalanine, xanthine and inosine were significantly elevated. Conclusion: The CAG rat model was successfully constructed by pathological manifestation of MNNG combined with ethanol gavage and abnormal of starvation. Metabolomics shows that the CAG model rat Zusanli (ST36) and gastric tissue are pathologically correlated, which may indicate that there is a certain relative specific relationship between gastric acupoints and stomach. \n",

      "Abstract: Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is the main cause of chemotherapy failure in lung cancer. How to prevent or reverse the MDR of lung cancer is still a clinically difficult problem to be solved. Traditional Chinese medicine compound prescription under the guidance of TCM syndrome differentiation theory has received increasing attention in the study of MDR of lung cancer. Based on the research of MDR mechanism of modern medical tumors, this paper concludes that Chinese herbal compound prescription can down-regulate membrane transport protein, reduce tumor cell detoxification and repair function, affect signal transduction apoptosis regulatory genes, cell cycle, extracellular matrix, mitochondria related molecular regulation effects and inhibition or interference with endoplasmic reticulum stress play a role in anti-drug resistance. It reflects the high-efficiency, low-toxicity and multi-target advantages of traditional Chinese medicine compound prescription intervention in lung cancer resistance. Related researchs provides a reference for clinical intervention and research on lung cancer resistance.\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy of Biqi Capsule combined with massage in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. Methods: Sixty patients with lumbar disc herniation were randomly divided into treatment group and control group, 30 cases in each group. Both groups were treated with massage. The treatment group was treated with sputum capsules 1.2 tid; the control group was treated with diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets 50mg bid. The course of treatment is 14d. After the end of treatment, the patients were evaluated for VAS score, JOA score, and adverse reactions before and after treatment. Results: After a single treatment, the VAS scores of the two groups were significantly different before and after treatment (P<0.01). The VAS scores were statistically significant before and after treatment (P<0.05). After 2 weeks of treatment, there was a significant difference in JOA scores between the two groups on Intra-group comparison before and after treatment (P<0.01). After 3 months of treatment, comparing between groups before and after treatment, the JOA scores were statistically significant (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 96.6% in the treatment group and 80% in the control group. The difference in total effective rate between the two groups was significant (P<0.01). Conclusion: Oral Biqi Capsule combined with massage and oral diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets combined with massage for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation can achieve satisfactory results. The effect of the two therapies is equivalent, but the long-term effect of oral Biqi Capsule combined with massage is greater than oral diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets combined with massage treatment, and the incidence of adverse reactions is lower. \n",
